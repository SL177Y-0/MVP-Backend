Algorithm Integration
Successfully implemented the scoring algorithm from algo.txt
Added proper error handling and null checks
Integrated with existing data sources (Twitter, wallet, Telegram)
Verida Integration
Fixed the API endpoint URL structures
Improved the authentication callback handler
Implemented multiple fallback approaches for data retrieval
Enhanced error handling for Verida API calls
Database Models
Set up User model with detailed score components
Created Score model for badge storage and wallet scores
Implemented Wallet model for tracking multiple wallet addresses
API Endpoints
Added /api/score/get-score endpoint for score calculation
Created /api/test-algorithm for testing without frontend
Set up /api/score/total-score/:privyId for retrieving scores
Logging & Debugging
Cleaned up console logs to show only essential information
Added structured logging for important events
Enhanced error reporting
ðŸ“‹ What's Left To Do
Testing & Validation
Create unit tests for the algorithm
Test the full flow with real data
Add input validation for all API endpoints
Performance Optimization
Add caching for frequently accessed data
Optimize database queries
Consider rate limiting for API calls
Data Security
Implement token rotation for Verida auth
Add additional validation for sensitive operations
Review data storage practices for sensitive information
Documentation
Create API documentation
Add inline code comments
Create setup guide for new developers
Deployment
Prepare for production deployment
Set up environment variables for production
Consider containerization with Docker




The MongoDB schemas look good for storing the algorithm results. Here's my analysis:
âœ… User Schema:
Has privyId as the main identifier (correctly set as unique)
Stores connection statuses for Twitter, wallet, and Verida
Has a well-structured scoreDetails object to store component scores and details
Includes timestamps for tracking when data was updated
âœ… Score Schema:
Uses privyId as the main identifier (correctly set as unique)
Stores separate scores for Twitter and Telegram (from Verida)
Has a totalScore field for the combined score
Includes an array of wallets with addresses and scores
Stores badges earned by the user
Only minor issue: email is marked as required, which might be too strict for some users
âœ… Wallet Schema:
Stores wallet addresses linked to users
Has a reference to the User model via userId
Properly indexed for efficient queries
Includes chainId and balance fields for wallet details
âœ… Data Integration:
NewScoreController.js correctly updates both User and Score models
Component scores are properly stored in both models
Badge information is correctly handled
The schemas provide a good foundation for storing the algorithm results. If you want to enhance them further, consider:
Making the email field optional in the Score schema (remove the required: true constraint)
Adding a field in the Score schema to store the user's title from the algorithm
Adding more detailed badge information (level, value) instead of just badge names
But these are optional improvements - your current schema structure is good to go for storing all the necessary data from the algorithm.
