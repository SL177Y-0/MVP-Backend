Based on my analysis, here's how the Verida flow is working and integrating with our algorithm and database:
âœ… Verida Flow
Authentication Flow:
Apply to Score.js
Frontend requests auth URL from /api/verida/auth/url
Backend generates URL with required scopes for Telegram data
User authenticates with Verida
Verida redirects back to our backend callback endpoint
Backend processes the token and redirects to frontend
Data Collection:
Apply to Score.js
Integration with Algorithm:
Apply to Score.js
The Telegram data from Verida is used in our algorithm to calculate:
Telegram score (max 15 points)
Community engagement score (max 20 points)
Badges like "Group Guru", "Message Maestro", etc.
Database Storage:
Apply to Score.js
ðŸ”„ Complete Flow
User Connects Verida:
Apply to Score.js
Backend Processes:
Apply to Score.js
Database Updates:
Apply to Score.js
Frontend Updates:
Apply to Score.js
âœ… Integration Points
Algorithm Integration:
Telegram data is properly fed into evaluateUser
Scores are calculated using our weights and thresholds
Badges are assigned based on Telegram activity
Database Integration:
Both User and Score models are updated
Multiple wallets are supported
Badges are stored in both models
Score Calculation:
Individual scores for Twitter, Telegram, and wallet
Total score is properly calculated
Badges are categorized by type
The flow is working correctly and integrating with our algorithm and database. The only potential improvement would be to add more error handling for cases where Verida API calls fail, but the core functionality is solid.
Would you like me to add any specific error handling or logging to any part of this flow?
