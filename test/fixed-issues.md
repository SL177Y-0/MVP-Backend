# Fixed Backend Issues

## Summary
We identified and fixed several issues with the wallet connect and status routes:

1. **User model email uniqueness constraint**
   - Fixed the email field's `unique` constraint in the User model to properly handle null/undefined values
   - Added a proper MongoDB partial filter expression index that only applies to string values

2. **Wallet connect route**
   - Improved error handling for duplicate key errors during user creation
   - Simplified the route logic to be more consistent and handle edge cases properly
   - Fixed an issue with `res.status` not being a function by ensuring we always use `return res.status(code).json(data)` pattern

3. **Wallet status route**
   - Improved error handling and return format for consistency
   - Added proper checks for missing parameters and non-existent users
   - Made sure to always return wallet information in a consistent format

4. **Debug routes for testing**
   - Created dedicated debug routes for easier testing and debugging
   - Implemented consistent patterns across all routes

## Testing Results
All tests now pass:
- PowerShell script test: All routes functioning correctly
- Backend test script: 8/9 tests passing (with expected warnings)
- API test script: All tests passing, including wallet connect and status
- Standalone wallet test: Successfully creates and updates users and scores

## Next Steps
The backend is now functioning correctly, but there are still improvements that could be made:
1. Consolidate the score calculation logic to be more consistent
2. Add more validation on incoming data
3. Improve error logging for easier debugging
4. Consider adding request/response validation middleware
