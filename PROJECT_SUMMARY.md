# MVP Backend Project Summary

## Project Overview
This document summarizes the key improvements, fixes, and enhancements made to the MVP Backend system during our development and refactoring process.

## Initial Analysis

The initial phase involved a comprehensive analysis of the backend implementation, with particular focus on:
- MongoDB schema structure and efficiency
- Security vulnerabilities
- Code architecture and organization
- Performance bottlenecks
- Data integrity issues

## Core Implementation Improvements

- Implemented secure token management with dedicated service
- Added API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Fixed potential data exposure vulnerabilities

### Architectural Improvements
- Created a standardized `BaseController` class for consistent error handling
- Implemented service-oriented architecture
- Reduced code duplication through proper abstraction
- Removed unnecessary files and deprecated code
- Consolidated scoring logic in a single controller
- Established consistent naming conventions across codebase

### Database Optimizations
- Added indexes to MongoDB collections for common queries 
- Fixed data consistency issues between Users and Scores collections
- Created script (`fix-db-consistency.js`) to repair inconsistencies
- Implemented schema validation in database models
- Optimized database query patterns

### Performance Improvements
- Implemented parallel data fetching for Twitter, Blockchain, and Telegram
- Added pagination to Verida requests with configurable parameters
- Optimized Telegram data retrieval with pagination
